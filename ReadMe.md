# Project README

## Merged Front and Back

The front-end and back-end of this project have been successfully merged to work together.

## CORS Issue Fixed

The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue has been resolved. Now, you should be able to make requests to the database without any problems.

## Making Requests to the Database

To make requests to the database, we are using Axios. As an example, you can refer to the `client/src/App.js` file to see how it's done.

## No Need to paste in the env varaibles for the database URL and Cosmos ENDPOINT i added them in a file that you have to include in your `server` directory.

## Adding Frontend React Components

You can easily add any Frontend React components to the project. For this purpose, please use the `client/src/components` directory.

Here are two components Folders you can start with:

1. **Home** -> This Folder can be used for the login and create game (Mario component).
2. **Game** -> This Folder can be used for other components related to the game.

## Adding CSS Styles

For adding custom CSS styles to the project, please create `styles` folder inside the Home/Game Folder.
